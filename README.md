# Alarm-Clock-Using-Python
This is an Alarm clock project.
In this project we used some python modules such as datetime and playsound.
We used the datetime module to get the current date and time and the playsound module is used to play the soundtrack.
when the program gets executed, it will ask if you want to set the alarm for a specific date or not
if not then it will directly ask you for the time in HH:MM:SS format
when the time goes out, then it will play the soundtrack to wake you up
You can even set the topic of your alarm
Have fun with the Alarm to be foucsed on your time to time daily work
